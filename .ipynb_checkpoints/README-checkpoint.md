# Energy Consumption Forecasting

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description
This repository contains a project aimed at forecasting energy consumption at building or grid-level by analyzing historical energy usage data, weather conditions, and occupancy patterns. We will explore multiple forecasting techniques, including traditional statistical methods (ARIMA, Prophet) and advanced deep learning models (Transformers, LSTM).
